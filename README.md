# Bellabeats-Case-Study
This repository houses the Bellabeats case study I completed for the Google Data Analytics Certification's capstone project. It is a full data analysis from data cleaning to recommendations. In this project I use **Google Sheets** for preliminary data cleaning and overview, and I then use **R Programming** for further calculations and visualizations.

The full case study demonstrating my thought-process is currently under a PDF file and the entire code is documented in an R Markdown file. I will soon be uploading this project to Kaggle to ensure better shareability!
